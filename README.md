# Web-Scraping - Mission to Mars 

In this project, we will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 
In the process, we used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs.
WE started by converting the Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.
